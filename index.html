                <h2> Er Mayank Kankoriya</h2>
                <p>My' self  Mayank , iam also a software Engineer from Datia Madhya Pradesh. I have completed my graduation in july 2021 in engineering with computer science background , from Rabindranath Tagore University bhopal  with an aggregate of 75.8%. currently iam doing FULL STACK development training from TIME'S PRO LEARNING. 

                    My father is an ex service man in indian army and my mother is home maker 
                    
                    My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, domain driven design, responsive design principles, website optimization, and the  Model View Controller (MVC) methods of organizing code. So far my skills are , HTML, CSS, bootstrap ,Scss, javascript and react for (frontend development)  and express, node js for (backend development) Git/GitHub under my belt. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.
                    I love applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing. It's oddly satisfying. I think in a way I'm kind of like those web pages; I'm moldable, but I still keep my creative flare intact
                    
                    My weakness is I can not tolerate any leniency in work
                    
                    My short term goal is I want a such a platform where I can grow my career along with the organization growth like yours and.
                    
                    My Long term goal is I want to be one of the reason for the success of the organization and I want to see your organization as a bench mark to other organizations.</p>
